            "content_html": "<p>The blockchain industry has grown tremendously over the past decade, with new projects launching regularly, each with unique selling points and eye-popping roadmaps. From the early days of the ICO boom to DeFi summer, we’re witnessing a rapid evolution of this utopian technology into a force for good.</p>\n<p>It’s now safe to say that the industry has lost its nascency and, for good measure, is shifting towards a better-connected world. You don’t have to search far and wide for evidence of blockchain’s maturation: an increasing number of <em>#BUIDLers</em>, and not merely core protocol developers anymore.</p>\n<p>Even more, end users are looking to smart contract developers for a stab at one of society’s conceptual challenges like elitist gatekeeping, centralization, trust, and transparency — or rather, the lack thereof — through decentralized applications (dapps).</p>\n<p>In the early Bitcoin days, all you wanted to do on the blockchain was send simple transactions back and forth. Or buy some Papa John’s with bitcoin (or <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/pictures/things-you-didnt-know-you-could-buy-with-bitcoins/14/?ref=coinhustle.com\">buy a beer</a>, idk😏). Those days are long gone now.</p>\n<p>(Now, we’ve literally become farmers on DeFi lending dapps with high yield. It's no secret that the premise of quadruple-digit returns has left us trapped in the overnight lambros — “Lambo bros” — pipe dream. But that's another story.)</p>\n<p>The Web3 movement is growing at a remarkable speed… far from being branded an “<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/the-irrational-exuberance-of-web3/?ref=coinhustle.com\">irrational exuberance</a>” (<em>the</em> nerve!) If I’m being “oh, so dramatic,” it’s because I’ve seen the limitless potential of blockchain among the current crop of emerging technologies.</p>\n<p>To this end, many blockchain projects have risen recently, intending to challenge the status quo and offer <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/topics/benefits-of-blockchain?ref=coinhustle.com\">numerous benefits</a>, including enhanced security, greater transparency, instant traceability, and increased efficiency and speed.</p>\n<p>Ethereum and the Internet Computer (ICP) are two of the biggest blockchains to gain significant attention in recent times. In effect, a direct consequence of their unique capabilities and potential to power next-gen dapps. The Internet Computer is a decentralized blockchain project developed by the DFINITY Foundation, a Swiss non-profit research organization.</p>\n<p>DFINITY Founder Dominic Williams created the Internet Computer as the next major leap in the blockchain timeline. Bitcoin launched the first cryptocurrency, and Ethereum introduced smart contracts to blockchains. The Internet Computer represents the third step — a \"limitless blockchain\" running at internet scale.</p>\n<p>Undoubtedly, Ethereum is the most popular blockchain project after Bitcoin. If you’re actually “in it for the tech,” you probably broke into crypto with the Ethereum project, not through its myriad dapps. Hats off to you, good <em>ser</em>.</p>\n<p>(For context, most crypto folks jumped on the <em>bandwag’n </em>during the Great Crypto Gold Rush, aka the <a href=\"https://news.crunchbase.com/fintech-ecommerce/2017s-ico-market-grew-nearly-100x-q1-q4/?ref=coinhustle.com\">2017 ICO boom</a>.)</p>\n<p>Like the Internet Computer, Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain platform for building smart contracts and dapps.</p>\n<p>Although both blockchains differ in core architecture, they share a critical common goal (amongst several other similarities): to integrate the presently fragmented blockchain landscape and better harness the power of blockchain interoperability for the good of humanity.</p>\n<p>In this article, we’ll examine the Internet Computer and Ethereum, along with a comprehensive guide to their features, key merits, and use cases. This will provide you with a detailed analysis of the capabilities and limitations of these two blockchain giants.</p>\n<p>By comparing both projects, we aim to show how these two blockchains can power the next generation of decentralized applications (dapps) and provide insight into the potential of blockchain technology to significantly transform virtually every industry known to man.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, this comparison will help developers, investors, and crypto enthusiasts decide which blockchain platform to use for their projects and applications. But first, let’s look at each one in more detail.</p>\n<p><em>Side note: This is the ultimate, comprehensive comparison between Ethereum and ICP, so it may be unusually long. Feel free to skip to specific sections using the table of contents.</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"internet-computer-icp\">Internet Computer (ICP)</h2>\n<p>Launched in May 2021, the Internet Computer is designed to provide faster, more secure, and more scalable decentralized web services than the current internet.</p>\n<p>You’re probably expecting some background information, so here's an overview of the fast-growing blockchain.</p>\n<h3 id=\"overview-of-the-internet-computer\">Overview of The Internet Computer</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/DFINITY_Foundation?ref=coinhustle.com\">DFINITY Foundation</a> — or, more correctly, “DFINITY Stiftung” — was initially founded in Zug in October 2016 with a stated goal: create a blockchain singularity, a <a href=\"https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/World_Computer?ref=coinhustle.com\">World Computer</a> branded DFINITY with a utility token named DFN. R&amp;D began soon after, and four months later, the DFN ledger went live on the Ethereum network.</p>\n<p>However, the project later rebranded to a more descriptive name: “Internet Computer”; the underlying protocol was named \"Internet Computer Protocol,\" and the token was renamed to the <a href=\"https://www.coinhustle.com/how-to-buy-icp-a-complete-guide-to-investing-in-internet-computer-cryptocurrency/\">ICP token</a>. DFINITY’s five-year effort, the blockchain industry’s largest R&amp;D operation, birthed the Internet Computer.</p>\n<p>One unique aspect of the Internet Computer is that it replaces centralized servers or traditional cloud infrastructure with specialized node hardware to run smart contracts and dapps directly on the blockchain.</p>\n<p>Here’s a rundown of the network’s key features and unique strengths.</p>\n<h3 id=\"icp-key-features-and-capabilities\">ICP Key Features and Capabilities</h3>\n<p>The Internet Computer is a public blockchain. I’ve probably said that one too many times already. Anyone, and I mean anyone, can participate in the network’s day-to-day. The network enables complete decentralization by hosting dapps fully on chain without centralized cloud providers.</p>\n<p><strong>Canisters and Subnets</strong></p>\n<p>The project offers a unique way of deploying special smart contracts, called \"canisters,\" on a vast network of nodes (<a href=\"https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/?ref=coinhustle.com\">over 1200 in total</a>). This makes them faster and more scalable than traditional smart contracts deployed on individual nodes.</p>\n<p>As for its architecture, the network is divided into multiple “subnets.” Each subnet (ICP lingo for <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/explained/sharding-explained?ref=coinhustle.com\">shard</a>) is a standalone blockchain that runs and processes transactions concurrently with others. All subnets run an instance of the core Internet Computer protocol stack, including consensus, to host smart contracts and dapps.</p>\n<p>With its novel architecture, the Internet Computer aims to enable developers to build reliable dapps that can scale infinitely. Motoko is a developer-friendly programming language that makes it easy to build dapps on the network. The syntax is similar to popular languages like Python and JavaScript.</p>\n<p><strong>Chain Key Cryptography</strong></p>\n<p>Indeed, the IC’s consensus protocol is designed to achieve low latency, high performance, and robustness (i.e., optimum performance anytime). Through <a href=\"https://www.coinhustle.com/chain-key-cryptography-enabling-blockchain-techs-third-revolution/\">chain-key cryptography</a>, the protocol provides cryptographically guaranteed finality to validate transactions and create new blocks.</p>\n<p><strong>Cross-chain Interoperability</strong></p>\n<p>Another salient feature of the Internet Computer is that it directly integrates with other blockchains without bridges using advanced cryptography. This is achieved using chain-key ECDSA signatures (an advanced form of threshold ECDSA), which allows the Internet Computer to natively create transactions on other blockchains like Bitcoin, and a native <a href=\"https://internetcomputer.org/ethereum-integration?ref=coinhustle.com\">ETH integration is underway</a>.</p>\n<p>For instance, ICP <a href=\"https://www.coinhustle.com/top-5-ways-bitcoin-integration-will-supercharge-icp-crypto/\">integrates with the Bitcoin network</a> at the protocol level. A canister smart contract can create Bitcoin addresses and send and receive Bitcoin directly on the Bitcoin ledger. Similarly, IC canisters will be able to use Ethereum-based tokens, and Ethereum smart contracts can leverage the capabilities of IC smart contracts.</p>\n<p><strong>Super-fast, Low-cost Transactions</strong></p>\n<p>Overall, the network can comfortably execute up to <a href=\"https://www.coinhustle.com/how-fast-can-a-blockchain-be-webspeed-says-the-internet-computer/\">11,500 transactions per second</a>with a 1-second finality. Notably, you can perform transactions for a fractional cost. And thanks to the reverse gas model, you don’t have to pay gas fees when interacting with smart contracts (more on this later).</p>\n<p><strong>Advantages and Benefits of The Internet Computer</strong></p>\n<p>The Internet Computer didn’t rise to prominence out of a competitive ambition for blockchain supremacy — a crypto arms race, if you will. Instead, it was birthed from a shared vision of improving current blockchain systems to tackle some of the world’s biggest problems.</p>\n<p>Even so, the Internet Computer protocol has several strong points that would make it a serious contender for a dominant position in the league of blockchains. If that were the goal, that is. We'll look at a few of them in this section, starting with these words: “web speed” and “internet scale.”</p>\n<p><strong>Superior Performance</strong></p>\n<p>To clarify, the Internet Computer’s superior performance remains perhaps the most prominent in its rather long list of merits. Historically, blockchains in general are known to suffer performance hiccups and transaction bottlenecks, particularly during high network activity.</p>\n<p>In contrast, ICP is designed to offer a responsive experience comparable to traditional web applications (aka web speed). This is achieved through efficient data caching, low-latency messaging, and parallel processing. WebAssembly, a low-level virtual machine is used to enable efficient code execution in a secure environment.</p>\n<p><strong>On-demand Scalability</strong></p>\n<p>And thanks to the internet scale, the Internet Computer can support a large number of dapps and users without degrading performance or compromising security. Its sharding mechanism distributes the workload across nodes, enabling high scalability and efficient resource utilization.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, the subnets are designed for high performance and can be adapted for various use cases and applications, leaving ample room for flexibility and innovation. For example, you can create a subnet for a DeFi lending solution collectively managed by participants — namely, liquidity providers, borrowers, etc.</p>\n<p><strong>Zero Gas Fees</strong></p>\n<p>In addition, ICP has a reverse gas model (aka “canister pays”) that allows users to interact with smart contracts without paying gas fees. Traditionally, blockchain systems require users to pay for the computational cost (“gas”) to execute transactions or interact with dapps.</p>\n<p>Cycles are the computational resources for executing actions on the Internet Computer; they’re what “gas” is to Ethereum. In simple terms, one cycle unit is the cost of executing a single WebAssembly instruction. Under the “Reverse Gas Model,” developers — not users — pre-pay gas costs by loading canister smart contracts with Cycles.</p>\n<p><strong>On-chain Decentralized Governance</strong></p>\n<p>And speaking of accessibility, the network employs an on-chain decentralized governance framework backed by the <a href=\"https://www.coinhustle.com/on-chain-governance-on-internet-computer-using-nns-an-overview/\">Network Nervous System (NNS)</a>. The NNS is usually dubbed the Internet Computer’s “brain” since it manages various processes from protocol upgrades and economics to node machines and canisters.</p>\n<p>Thanks to the NNS, anyone can contribute to the stewardship of the Internet Computer. The ICP utility token is used in protocol governance. <a href=\"https://www.coinhustle.com/how-to-stake-icp-tokens-on-the-internet-computers-network-nervous-system-nns/\">ICP holders can stake their tokens</a> in neurons and vote on pending proposals with the locked neurons.</p>\n<p><strong>Decentralized Identity</strong></p>\n<p>Finally, the Internet Computer safeguards your online identity and activity against bad actors using <a href=\"https://www.coinhustle.com/how-to-create-your-internet-identity-easy-step-by-step-guide/\">Internet Identity (II)</a>. II introduces passwordless login by leveraging Web3 authentication using physical devices and hardware security keys.</p>\n<p>Internet Identity’s anonymous blockchain authentication framework ensures you control your data and backs it up for secure access on the blockchain. You can create an Identity Anchor and manage your digital identities without relying on centralized services like Google and Facebook.</p>\n<p>Okay! Enough deets on the Internet Computer for now. Let’s look at the mother of smart contract blockchains: Ethereum.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ethereum\">Ethereum</h2>\n<p>Truth be told, the grand jury’s still out on whether the upsides of blockchain technology far outweigh its few drawbacks.</p>\n<p>Either way, I’d probably go out on a limb and say the entire blockchain community is eternally grateful for Satoshi Nakamoto’s work in birthing the disruptive technology that we’ve come to know and enjoy today.</p>\n<p>And again, I think it’s safe to say that Vitalik Buterin’s trophy cabinet is almost as brimming as his enigmatic muse. The Ethereum project continues to raise the bar for blockchains, not to mention his <a href=\"https://vitalik.ca/?ref=coinhustle.com\">eye-opening quips</a> that have inspired countless other builders to tackle key technological challenges.</p>\n<p>No doubt, Ethereum’s had a hot streak since it went live almost a decade ago. Ah! The 2017 ICO bubble, DeFi summer, and the NFT craze… Ethereum has played a key role in the blockchain timeline.</p>\n<p>We’ll briefly look over Ethereum’s key features, strong points, and perks in the next sections.</p>\n<h3 id=\"overview-of-ethereum\">Overview of Ethereum</h3>\n<p>Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain platform that enables developers to build dapps and execute smart contracts. The project was conceptualized in late 2013 in a white paper, and development began in 2014 by a team of core developers headed by co-founder Vitalik Buterin.</p>\n<p>Ethereum is powered by ether, a utility token that facilitates network transactions. The network went live in July 2015 and has since become one of the most popular blockchains, boasting the second-largest market capitalization after Bitcoin.</p>\n<p>However, Ethereum is designed to be more flexible and adaptable than Bitcoin, which is primarily used as a digital currency. It’s noteworthy that Bitcoin’s creation set in motion a series of events that led to Ethereum.</p>\n<p>More specifically, Buterin argued that Bitcoin (and blockchain in general) should have more use cases besides financial transactions and that it needed a robust language for building apps that could help tokenize real-world assets (e.g., stocks) on the blockchain.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ethereum-key-features-and-capabilities\">Ethereum Key Features and Capabilities</h3>\n<p>A standout feature of the Ethereum blockchain is smart contracts. Smart contracts are digital contracts that automatically enforce the terms of an agreement. They’re programming logic (code) deployed to the blockchain and triggered to self-execute when certain conditions are met.</p>\n<p>Ethereum ushered in a tsunami of projects and onboarded millions of users within half a decade of its launch. These projects can run on the blockchain without needing an intermediary or sole controlling authority, not to mention there is no single point of failure. This makes dapps more secure, transparent, and resistant to censorship.</p>\n<p>Thanks to smart contracts, developers can create complex and immutable decentralized applications with automated transactions, such as token issuance, voting systems, and prediction markets.</p>\n<p>Have you ever used virtual machine software? Personally, I use them to run different operating systems on my Windows PC (Kali and Tails sit atop this list, no thanks to my <em>*wink wink*</em> activities, but I digress).</p>\n<p>Now, Ethereum has its own virtual machine (EVM), which sits at the heart of code execution on the blockchain. The EVM compiles smart contract logic to bytecode, allowing dapps to run on any computer connected to the Ethereum network.</p>\n<p>This makes sense since the deployed contract is no longer a high-level programming language but now machine code, at least in a way.</p>\n<p>On 15 September 2022, Ethereum 2.0 went live, effectively transitioning its consensus mechanism from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS). This upgrade, known as \"the Merge,\" was the final in a series of upgrades (“phases”). This switch has cut Ethereum's energy usage by 99%.</p>\n<p>Finally, Ethereum has several token standards, including ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155, which enable the creation of custom tokens on the Ethereum network. This has led to the creation of thousands of new tokens, including stablecoins, utility tokens, NFTs, and governance tokens.</p>\n<h3 id=\"advantages-and-benefits-of-ethereum\">Advantages and Benefits of Ethereum</h3>\n<p>The Internet Computer and Ethereum are two blockchain projects that have gained significant attention in recent years due to their unique potential to power the next generation of decentralized applications (dapps).</p>\n<p>It’s common for crypto enthusiasts and publications to tag every smart contract blockchain launched post-Ethereum as the latter’s “killer.”</p>\n<p>Quite on the contrary, the DFINITY Foundation and the ICP community have always maintained an aversion to this moniker. Instead, the taxonomic preference for the Internet Computer is as an “enhancer” to the Ethereum blockchain.</p>\n<p>In the same vein, Ethereum has numerous advantages that make it a safe haven for blockchain enthusiasts and developers. Here are a few of them.</p>\n<p>For one, Ethereum is highly flexible as it enables developers to create a wide range of dapps. These range from DeFi (lending, borrowing, and trading platforms) to play-to-earn gaming platforms. The blockchain also allows anyone to create and exchange cryptocurrency tokens and NFTs.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Ethereum’s decentralized nature ensures that there’s no central controlling authority. This has the added benefit of censorship resistance, which is particularly essential for dapps that rely on trust and transparency.</p>\n<p>Picture a decentralized network housing thousands of nodes and bad actors gaining control over the network. Hard to picture, yes? Ethereum has far better security and network integrity than centralized systems, with no single point of failure.</p>\n<p>Finally, Ethereum’s token standards promote interoperability by enabling developers to build new dapps that can interact with existing dapps. This feature has proven particularly useful in the DeFi sector, where new financial instruments leverage several dapps and tokens.</p>\n<h2 id=\"internet-computer-vs-ethereum\">Internet Computer vs Ethereum</h2>\n<p>Ethereum has enabled the creation of countless decentralized applications and tokens. As the blockchain industry continues to grow and evolve, Ethereum is likely to remain a key player in the space.</p>\n<p>Internet Computer is a powerful blockchain platform. Its flexibility, security, and decentralization make it an attractive option for developers looking to build large-scale decentralized applications.</p>\n<h3 id=\"comparison-of-technical-specifications\">Comparison of Technical Specifications</h3>\n<p>The Internet Computer and Ethereum are both decentralized blockchains; however, they don’t share a similar approach to achieving decentralization. Not to mention that the concept of decentralization has several dimensions and cannot be understood as a whole.</p>\n<p>Ethereum deploys smart contracts on single nodes, while a canister uploaded into the Internet Computer is assigned a subnet containing multiple nodes on which it’s installed. The subnet only runs on the nodes that participate in that subnet. This ensures that the results are correct, that the network is robust, and that canisters run forever.</p>\n<p>Moreover, Ethereum had previously used proof-of-work (PoW) for consensus, causing high energy consumption and high transaction fees during network congestion. Now with proof-of-stake consensus, the network has tackled the energy problem.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the Internet Computer employs a novel consensus mechanism powered by Chain Key cryptography, a set of cryptographic protocols that orchestrate nodes on the Internet Computer.</p>\n<p>Through Chain Key cryptography, the Internet Computer has a <em>single</em> public key. Even more, all nodes hosting a canister receive secret key shares that enable them to jointly sign messages (transactions). The network validates messages with the public key, drastically reducing transaction time.</p>\n<p>Ethereum and Internet Computer have an average block time (the amount of time between blocks) of 12.08 seconds and 0.936 seconds respectively. The average transaction cost for ICP is $0.0000022, while Ethereum’s is $2.39.</p>\n<p>Also, the on-chain storage cost (for storing 1 GB of data per year on chain) for Internet Computer and Ethereum is $5 (3.95T cycles x 1XDR) and $15,494,409 (12,643.75 ETH).</p>\n<p>In terms of programming languages, Ethereum supports Solidity (native), Vyper, Yul, and FE. Solidity is a specialized language for smart contracts, while Internet Computer supports multiple programming languages, including Motoko (native), Rust, TypeScript, and Python.</p>\n<h3 id=\"comparison-of-use-cases\">Comparison of Use Cases</h3>\n<p>Both Ethereum and Internet Computer have a wide range of use cases, including decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming, social networks, and supply chain management.</p>\n<p>However, Ethereum has been around for much longer and has a more established dapp ecosystem. Many of the most popular DeFi protocols and dapps, such as Uniswap, Aave, and OpenSea, are mainly built on Ethereum.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Internet Computer's unique features, such as its ability to run traditional web services and integrate with other blockchains, make it a promising platform for enterprise IT applications and large-scale decentralized projects.</p>\n<p>Other use cases of the Internet Computer include decentralized web hosting, digital identity management, and messaging.</p>\n<h3 id=\"comparison-of-performance-and-scalability\">Comparison of Performance and Scalability</h3>\n<p>Ethereum had faced scalability issues due to its PoW consensus mechanism, resulting in high gas fees and slow processing times during periods of network congestion. The recent Ethereum 2.0 upgrade switched the network to proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus.</p>\n<p>Internet Computer’s Chain Key cryptography allows for faster and more energy-efficient processing of transactions. Additionally, Internet Computer's architecture enables it to scale horizontally, meaning it can add more nodes to the network on demand.</p>\n<p>In terms of performance, the Internet Computer has an average MIEPs (millions of executed transactions per second) of 20,000, while Ethereum’s maximum MIEPs is 1.25. Ethereum’s average TPS is 11.1 transactions per second in contrast to ICP’s 5382 tx/s.</p>\n<p>Internet Computer's ability to scale dynamically, combined with its high-speed processing capabilities, could make it a more scalable platform than Ethereum in the long run.</p>\n<h2 id=\"which-one-is-a-better-investment\">Which One is a Better Investment?</h2>\n<p>As with any investment, there is no one-size-fits-all answer. Ethereum is more established with a larger ecosystem of decentralized applications. Even more, it has a large community of developers and supporters, which has helped it maintain its position behind Bitcoin.</p>\n<p>Notably, this community has contributed to the development of numerous dapps and protocols. In fact, a lot of experts predict Ethereum will continue playing a key role in the space.</p>\n<p>However, the Internet Computer could potentially disrupt traditional industries and create new use cases for blockchain technology. It can integrate with traditional web services and communicate with other blockchains, helping position it as a key player in the emerging decentralized internet.</p>\n<p>The blockchain’s unique features, such as its scalability and interoperability, could make it a promising investment for those looking to capitalize on the potential of blockchain technology.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the DFINITY Foundation, the non-profit backing the Internet Computer project, has received funding from prominent investors and venture capital firms. This backing provides a level of stability and credibility to the project, making it a potentially attractive investment for those looking to “play it safe.”</p>\n<p>In contrast, the Internet Computer is a newer platform that is still in its early stages of development. While this comes with more uncertainty and risk, it also presents an opportunity for investors to get in on the ground floor of potentially revolutionary technology and garner massive gains.</p>\n<p>Finally, it's worth considering the current market conditions and future potential of each platform. Ethereum has been around for several years and has, in a manner of speaking, bloomed. While there is still room for growth, some investors may view Ethereum as a more mature investment with less potential for explosive growth.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The Ethereum network and the Internet Computer are two blockchains that have risen in popularity over the past couple of years. Although they’re much different in core architecture, they share striking similarities in their end goals.</p>\n<p>DFINITY Founder Dominic Williams has repeatedly stressed how the Internet Computer’s history is “inextricably linked” with the Ethereum project. The Ethereum community provided initial funding, and its core devs contributed in the early days of the former.</p>\n<p>The key distinction is that Ethereum stores smart contract logic, while Internet Computer dapps run entirely on the blockchain. Additionally, the Internet Computer provides a seamless user experience since most dapps can be accessed from the browser without installing extensions.</p>\n<p>On the performance front, Ethereum’s occasional congestion and stifling gas fees have made it somewhat hostile to the development of new dapps. However, the network has migrated to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, which will probably reduce energy consumption.</p>\n<p>A key selling point of the Internet Computer lies in its ability to support massive amounts of user data and transactions. As I mentioned earlier, the network could scale horizontally to handle up to millions of transactions per second.</p>\n<p>Although dapps can be built on both Ethereum and the Internet Computer, they vary slightly in their use cases and end users. Ethereum powers thousands of dapps, with use cases ranging from DeFi and gaming to healthcare and supply chain management.</p>\n<p>The Internet Computer can conveniently support a vast array of use cases, thanks to its superior performance. For instance, the low cost of on-chain storage makes it a great option for building decentralized storage platforms and web hosting services.</p>\n<p>Even more, the network could be used to power digital payments and identity management solutions due to its high security. Decentralized messaging is also a strong possibility since the network can scale to support a large number of users.</p>\n<p>Overall, it’s imperative for developers and users to carefully examine the technical specifications, use cases, and performance measures for each platform before choosing one for their project.</p>\n<p>In all, it's important to keep an open mind (DYOR) and consider factors beyond technical specs and use cases when making investment decisions.</p>",

By combining decentralised node hardware, ICP offers developers the ability to host and build software applications without the constraints of traditional cloud services. With its decentralised infrastructure, AI hosted on ICP is inherently immune to cyberattacks, meaning sensitive data remains protected from intrusion and manipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"0f45\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph yj yk uj yl b ym yn yo yp yq yr ys yt yu yv yw yx yy yz za zb zc zd ze zf zg jd bx\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">For instance, ICP has already demonstrated its capability by running neural networks for tasks like image classification and facial recognition. The upcoming ability to run larger AI models such as Llama 3 on ICP opens the door for even more advanced AI-driven applications. The notion that AI running on a public network can be immune to cyberattacks, operate without interruptions, and remain accessible at all times represents a fundamental shift in how we approach the deployment of AI in critical sectors like healthcare, finance, and government.</p>\n<p id=\"5361\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph yj yk uj yl b ym yn yo yp yq yr ys yt yu yv yw yx yy yz za zb zc zd ze zf zg jd bx\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><strong class=\"yl gu\">The Utopia Cloud: Sovereign, Secure, and Serverless</strong></p>\n<p id=\"0d0f\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph yj yk uj yl b ym yn yo yp yq yr ys yt yu yv yw yx yy yz za zb zc zd ze zf zg jd bx\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">One of the most impressive aspects of ICP’s technology is the introduction of Utopia, a private, serverless cloud built using ICP’s decentralized architecture. This technology aims to solve two of the biggest pain points in the current digital infrastructure: cybersecurity and the productivity of IT personnel.</p>\n<p id=\"fa81\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph yj yk uj yl b ym yn yo yp yq yr ys yt yu yv yw yx yy yz za zb zc zd ze zf zg jd bx\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Utopia’s serverless architecture not only enhances efficiency but also removes the need for traditional firewalls and cybersecurity measures that are often prone to failure. By eliminating the reliance on centralized IT infrastructure, Utopia ensures that applications hosted on it are impervious to cyberattacks, all while running smoothly without fear of downtime.</p>\n<p id=\"5c92\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph yj yk uj yl b ym yn yo yp yq yr ys yt yu yv yw yx yy yz za zb zc zd ze zf zg jd bx\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Governments and corporations with heightened concerns about data sovereignty can benefit significantly from Utopia. Countries can create their own sovereign clouds where data never leaves their borders, and where no foreign authority can access sensitive information. By leveraging open-source technology, Utopia ensures that no backdoors exist, making it an appealing option for entities requiring stringent data privacy and security.</p>\n<p id=\"a661\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph yj yk uj yl b ym yn yo yp yq yr ys yt yu yv yw yx yy yz za zb zc zd ze zf zg jd bx\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><strong class=\"yl gu\">A Revolutionary AI Development Paradigm</strong></p>\n<p id=\"6410\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph yj yk uj yl b ym yn yo yp yq yr ys yt yu yv yw yx yy yz za zb zc zd ze zf zg jd bx\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">ICP is not just about decentralisation and cybersecurity; it is poised to revolutionize how AI applications are developed and deployed. Traditional app development requires a deep understanding of complex languages, database systems, and cloud orchestration, but ICP promises to make the process dramatically simpler and more intuitive. With its AI-enhanced development framework, users will be able to describe the applications they want in natural language, and the AI will automatically generate fully functional web applications hosted on ICP.</p>\n<p id=\"65bf\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph yj yk uj yl b ym yn yo yp yq yr ys yt yu yv yw yx yy yz za zb zc zd ze zf zg jd bx\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">This new model has the potential to reduce development time and costs by orders of magnitude, making advanced application development accessible to everyone, regardless of technical expertise. The AI-driven development model also eliminates vendor lock-in, meaning users retain full ownership of their applications and data without being tied to a specific platform. The potential applications of this technology are limitless, from ERP systems to social media platforms, e-commerce websites, and even AI-powered applications designed to create other AIs.</p>\n<p id=\"1ec2\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph yj yk uj yl b ym yn yo yp yq yr ys yt yu yv yw yx yy yz za zb zc zd ze zf zg jd bx\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><strong class=\"yl gu\">Redefining Cybersecurity and System Resilience</strong></p>\n<p id=\"d485\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph yj yk uj yl b ym yn yo yp yq yr ys yt yu yv yw yx yy yz za zb zc zd ze zf zg jd bx\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Today, cybercrime costs are projected to reach $9.2 trillion annually, the need for resilient, secure systems has never been greater.

Avalanche is the first blockchain to form a partnership with AWS, and the move could mean increased adoption of blockchain technologies by institutional investors. Institutional entities can only view this as a positive step for the blockchain industry and one that signifies an increased level of trust for the crypto industry.</p>\n<p>The move heralds an increase in developer interest in AVAX and the wider blockchain industry. Developing on AVAX has now become easier as a result of this partnership, as developers will have AWS support for launching and managing nodes on the AVAX blockchain.</p>\n<p>Subnet deployment is in the works to be added. A logical subdivision of an IP network, subnet deployment will allow both individual users, as well as enterprises and institutions to set up their own custom subnets through AWS.</p>\n<p>While this is the first AWS partnership with a blockchain project, blockchains such as Ethereum and others use AWS to power their networks. With that in mind, blockchain partnership with AWS was always more of a question of when than if; and it seems as though now is the perfect time.</p>\n<p>The real question, though, is if a move to centralized cloud computing platforms like AWS is better than full-stack decentralization?</p>\n<p><strong><em>We think the answer is no.</em></strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"storage-costs\"><strong>Storage Costs</strong></h2>\n<p>Cloud storage has become an enormous expense for tech companies, with many building gigantic data centers in multiple locations just to handle all the centralized data. Data storage can be up to half the infrastructure bill for many tech companies.</p>\n<p>Dfinity provides a network which is truly decentralized from end-to-end. Information can be stored on-chain with DFINITY by way of the IC's built-in decentralized storage network.</p>\n<p>Decentralized storage is emerging as a cost-effective alternative to this centralized form of storage. Decentralized cloud storage utilizes untapped storage potential across the network and is a much more resourceful way of storing data. End-to-end encryption makes storage of data in this manner completely secure, which is <a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/work-life/cybersecurity-staff-are-struggling-heres-how-to-support-them-better/?ref=coinhustle.com\">not something that can always be said about centralised cloud storage.</a></p>\n<p>The creation of more and more applications kept on centralized cloud storage has led to an explosion of data. Data to be stored has been increasing exponentially, and this is causing issues for storage providers. Stored data continues to be added, with no data being deleted on the back end; this is making it continuously more difficult to store data efficiently.</p>\n<p>On top of this, the amount of data being produced annually is absolutely astonishing. In 2022 94 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettabyte_Era?ref=coinhustle.com\">zettabytes</a> of data will have been created, an amount Google calls; \"an unimaginable amount of data.\" One zettabyte is equal to <em>a trillion</em>Gigabytes.</p>\n<p>Successful applications stored on centralized cloud servers are cheap to get started but face cost issues as traffic starts to increase. Costs quickly mount up for such applications and eat into profit margins.</p>\n<h2 id=\"decentralized-storage\"><strong>Decentralized Storage</strong></h2>\n<p>The advantages of full-stack decentralization over traditional centralized hosting are huge. There is no centralized point of failure. Instead, nodes are distributed across the network, and a ledger of all transactions is maintained at each node. There is no single point of entry to the network, removing many of the issues that arise when traditional centralized servers are subjected to high levels of traffic.</p>\n<p>Domestic storage, by comparison to centralized cloud storage, is far more abundant in the world. Computers in people's homes make up the vast majority of storage in existence.</p>\n<p>Decentralized methods of storage harness the untapped potential of all of this domestic memory. Domestic hard drives use very little of their available disc space, with 75% of drives using less than 25% of their storage capacity.</p>\n<p>Overheads for use of decentralized storage are far cheaper, and so is bandwidth. Bandwidth costs can reach obscene prices in data centers; however, in the domestic setting, they are far more reasonable, often by thousands of dollars per gigabit second.</p>\n<p>Those offering up their machines for use as part of the network are incentivized to provide high-quality storage. This creates healthy competition and ensures that the standard of storage provided remains high.</p>\n<p>Another advantage of decentralized storage is that no data centers need to be built, reducing costs from the get-go. This alone is a large positive for decentralized computing, making it simpler, easier, and more efficient all round.</p>\n<p>The stage looks to be set for the decentralized computing power provided by the IC.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-metaverse\"><strong>The Metaverse</strong></h2>\n<p>The Metaverse hype has been very real over the past few years, and in many ways, the world is watching and waiting for the first truly immersive implementation.</p>\n<p>One thing is for certain; Metaverse technology almost certainly needs to make use of decentralized storage in order to live up to its full potential.</p>\n<p>The IC network has been purpose-built to facilitate large-scale applications, such as a decentralized Metaverse. (Or multiple decentralized Metaverses, for that matter).</p>\n<p>With Metaverse worlds sure to have a huge number of players playing across gigantic worlds, which will only grow over time, the cloud computing demands of future Metaverse projects will be extremely large. Public cloud providers such as the IC can provide distributed points of presence globally, which allows for decreased latency of graphics in Metaverse applications.</p>\n<p>Over the next few years, Metaverse projects are sure to receive a lot more funding, and growth in the sector looks sure to continue for years to come.</p>\n<h2 id=\"defi\"><strong>DeFi</strong></h2>\n<p>The growth of the Dfinity ecosystem has meant a higher standard of DeFi applications in Web3. With the ability to leverage the built-in decentralized storage of the network, Defi applications can function at their absolute best.</p>\n<p>The Defi system is extremely efficient in comparison to Tradfi. It is open 24 hours per day, allows exposure to global markets, and allows trading in a whole host of different currencies.</p>\n<p>High fees and low flexibility mean that centralized storage options are not perfect for DeFi applications. Decentralized cloud storage, on the other hand, is ideally suited.</p>\n<p>There are many ways in which DeFi is superior, and the Dfinity ecosystem facilitates this. Over time Defi on the IC looks set to grow and grow, in user base and in popularity.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-future\"><strong>The Future</strong></h2>\n<p>It looks like full-stack decentralization will see greater adoption as time goes on. The advantages provided to developers are huge, and applications can be allowed to reach their full potential by utilizing the technology.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, centralized cloud storage seems to be facing more and more issue as data keeps piling up.</p>\n<p>Decentralized applications are only going to become better, faster, and more powerful. As more users are onboarded, the adoption of decentralized applications will speed up.</p>\n<p>It truly is an exciting time for decentralization technology, and the Dfinity ecosystem will most certainly be at the forefront of innovation.</p>",

In short, what makes the Internet Computer unique?</p>\n<p>Let’s take a look at how the Internet Computer Protocol blockchain really shows off the power of web3!</p>\n<h2 id=\"1-transactions-that-take-place-at-web-speed\">#1 Transactions that Take Place at Web Speed</h2>\n<p>One of the things that have hindered web3 adoption is that blockchain transactions are usually much slower than interactions with traditional web2 applications. But the Internet Computer has changed all of that. With finality occurring in under two seconds, dApps on the Internet Computer can query and update at web speed. In other words, transactions take place at the speeds we have all grown accustomed to when using web2 applications.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><a data-no-swup=\"\" data-fslightbox=\"\" href=\"https://www.coinhustle.com/content/images/2023/06/image-59.png\" aria-label=\"Click for Lightbox\"><figure class=\"lazyload lazy loaded\"><img  src=\"https://www.coinhustle.com/content/images/2023/06/image-59.png\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\" srcset=\"https://www.coinhustle.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/06/image-59.png 600w, https://www.coinhustle.com/content/images/2023/06/image-59.png 1000w\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"566\" loading=\"lazy\" data-was-processed=\"true\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></a>\n<figcaption>A comparison of Internet Computer transaction speeds versus several other top blockchains (via internetcomputer.org)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>How is this possible? Despite the jokes many of us in the community make, it’s not actually alien technology. It’s possible thanks to breakthrough tech called Chain Key Cryptography. Since the top cryptographers in the world work at the DFINITY Foundation, it’s better if I let them <a href=\"https://medium.com/dfinity/chain-key-technology-one-public-key-for-the-internet-computer-6a3644901e28?ref=coinhustle.com\">explain Chain Key Cryptography on their blog</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2-the-reverse-gas-model\">#2 The Reverse Gas Model</h2>\n<p>One of the biggest complaints people have about the Ethereum blockchain (and many others) is fluctuating gas fees. Why should you have to wait to make a transaction so you can get a better deal on the fees? And can you imagine a social media app that runs on a blockchain with gas fees? There are numerous dapps on other blockchains that require you to connect a wallet and pay a fee every time you interact with them, even when creating a new account. This isn't the way to attract web2 users to adopt decentralized apps.</p>\n<p>The Internet Computer solves the gas fee problem with <strong>reverse gas fees</strong>.</p>\n<p>When developers set up a canister (IC smart contract), they pre-pay for the fees by loading what is called cycles. Basically, the cost of computation cycles is baked into the smart contract so that users can interact with the dApp using a normal browser without having to connect a wallet and pay fees. This allows Internet Computer dApps to be 100% hosted on-chain (no AWS or other centralized hosting services).</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><a data-no-swup=\"\" data-fslightbox=\"\" href=\"https://www.coinhustle.com/content/images/2023/06/image-60.png\" aria-label=\"Click for Lightbox\"><figure class=\"lazyload lazy loaded\"><img  src=\"https://www.coinhustle.com/content/images/2023/06/image-60.png\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\" srcset=\"https://www.coinhustle.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/06/image-60.png 600w, https://www.coinhustle.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/06/image-60.png 1000w, https://www.coinhustle.com/content/images/2023/06/image-60.png 1183w\" alt=\"\" width=\"1183\" height=\"665\" loading=\"lazy\" data-was-processed=\"true\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></a>\n<figcaption>Transaction fee costs comparison for major blockchains (via InfinitySwap)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Cycles are stable and do not fluctuate in cost with the price of ICP, so developers can be confident in knowing how much the fees will cost. The development team can reload more cycles later as they run low.</p>\n<p><em>NOTE: There may be occasions where a user pays a small fee (0.0001 ICP) for transfers, such as when sending tokens between wallets or purchasing an NFT.</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"3-a-green-blockchain\">#3 A Green Blockchain</h2>\n<p>The Internet Computer has managed to combine all of this speed and affordability while still using a <a href=\"https://www.coinhustle.com/crypto-in-the-age-of-climate-change/\">minimal amount</a> of energy. One of the main concerns about blockchain use, in general, is energy consumption. Meanwhile, a transaction on the Internet Computer uses just 1/500 of the energy of a transaction on Ethereum!</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><a data-no-swup=\"\" data-fslightbox=\"\" href=\"https://www.coinhustle.com/content/images/2023/06/image-61.png\" aria-label=\"Click for Lightbox\"><figure class=\"lazyload lazy loaded\"><img  src=\"https://www.coinhustle.com/content/images/2023/06/image-61.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"519\" height=\"423\" loading=\"lazy\" data-was-processed=\"true\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></a>\n<figcaption>A comparison of energy use of major blockchains (via internetcomputer.org)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Of course, you may say that using less energy than other blockchains is easy. But the Internet Computer is also ahead of web2 tech companies when it comes to energy consumption. For example, a single Google search consumes a comparable amount of energy to four Internet Computer transactions!</p>\n<p>The Internet Computer is already lightyears ahead of the competition when it comes to being eco-friendly, in both web2 and web3, and that competitive edge is continually being honed to ensure a sustainable future for the blockchain.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4-affordable-on-chain-storage\">#4 Affordable On-Chain Storage</h2>\n<p>If you've ever heard an interview with Dominic Williams (Founder and Chief Scientist at the DFINITY Foundation), you've probably heard him discuss the fact that ICP projects have the ability to be built on-chain. While projects on other blockchains may make this claim, the actual websites and dApps are usually hosted on AWS or other centralized cloud hosts. Why is this the case?</p>\n<p>If you look at the chart below, it is simply a numbers game. How could any company afford to build on the Ethereum blockchain when storing just one GB of data on the blockchain would put most companies out of business? Even on comparatively more affordable chains like Cardano or Solana, this is still way too much overhead when compared to the affordability of centralized web hosting services. No web3 startup project could afford those prices.</p>\n<p>The astounding affordability of on-chain storage for the Internet Computer (about $5/year for one GB of data) creates an environment where on-chain storage is finally possible! And affordable on-chain storage paves the way for other web3 values, such as decentralization and censorship resistance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5-the-sns-will-perpetuate-autonomous-dapps-and-web3-services\">#5 The SNS Will Perpetuate Autonomous dApps and Web3 Services</h2>\n<p>This is yet another essential element to building a web3 blockchain, and only the Internet Computer is already offering this type of solution. The SNS (Service Nervous System) allows crypto projects to launch a \"decentralization sale\" of network governance tokens. This allows a business to be run without a board of directors but rather with the network governance taking place 100% on-chain.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><a data-no-swup=\"\" data-fslightbox=\"\" href=\"https://www.coinhustle.com/content/images/2023/06/image-62.png\" aria-label=\"Click for Lightbox\"><figure class=\"lazyload lazy loaded\"><img  src=\"https://www.coinhustle.com/content/images/2023/06/image-62.png\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\" srcset=\"https://www.coinhustle.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/06/image-62.png 600w, https://www.coinhustle.com/content/images/2023/06/image-62.png 957w\" alt=\"\" width=\"957\" height=\"272\" loading=\"lazy\" data-was-processed=\"true\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></a>\n<figcaption>The progression of the internet has led us here (via internetcomputer.org)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2 id=\"what-makes-the-internet-computer-blockchain-a-world-computer\">What Makes the Internet Computer Blockchain a World Computer?</h2>\n<p>The Internet Computer blockchain makes it affordable and feasible to host unstoppable, tamperproof code on-chain. This allows for a decentralized internet that runs everything from social networks to enterprise systems. So what makes the Internet Computer unique? It is a true world computer capable of hosting everything we interact with in a decentralized manner consistent with web3 values.</p>",

I’m about to drop the alpha on some of the NFT projects in the IC with rising floor prices and how DeFi is pushing NFT sales in the hopes of token drops.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-first-tradable-meme-coin-on-the-internet-computer\">The First Tradable Meme Coin on the Internet Computer</h2>\n<p>Dfinity Donkeys was the first team to drop a meme coin to wallets, and a second drop of $DONGE is coming soon. But I have to save that information for later in the article because another team beat them to become the first meme token listed on an IC DEX. $GHOST token has more than 30x’d over the course of the past couple of weeks (in sharp contrast to the price of ICP, which followed the larger crypto market and is down about 35% after nearly hitting $10/coin last week).</p>\n<p>What does this have to do with NFTs? It all started with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/icplink/status/1537421100971216896?s=20&amp;t=CBTS5d9ab50UOPsEMfwLgg&amp;ref=coinhustle.com\">a Tweet back in June</a>. @icplink asked the pokedstudio, BTC Flower, Cronics, OG Medals, IC Dinos, Dfinity Space Apes, ICPuppies, ICPCS, and ICP Dog teams to have their holders add this canister to their Stoic wallets: xzcnc-myaaa-aaaak-abk7a-cai. Of course, no one knew what this project was, so these top teams weren’t in a hurry to shill the IC Ghost collection. The Ghost NFTs were airdropped to those projects' holders without much fanfare, and some recipients didn't know about it at all.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><a data-no-swup=\"\" data-fslightbox=\"\" href=\"https://www.coinhustle.com/content/images/2023/07/image-60.png\" aria-label=\"Click for Lightbox\"><figure class=\"lazyload lazy loaded\"><img  src=\"https://www.coinhustle.com/content/images/2023/07/image-60.png\" srcset=\"https://www.coinhustle.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/07/image-60.png 600w, https://www.coinhustle.com/content/images/2023/07/image-60.png 604w\" alt=\"\" width=\"604\" height=\"628\" loading=\"lazy\" data-was-processed=\"true\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></a>\n<figcaption>This Tweet was the only real notice that IC Ghost NFTs were coming, and it doesn't mention the $GHOST drop.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>About a month later, in July, people holding IC Ghost NFTs were dropped 510,000 $GHOST tokens per NFT. Again, most people didn’t know because they had no idea they had even received an NFT. Next came the listing on ICPSwap. No one had really heard of this token, which has a total supply of 10 billion, and yet 5.1 billion of those tokens were already in the wallets of many of the top projects on the Internet Computer. Plus, more tokens were sent to ICPSwap in order to add liquidity. The $GHOST pool was giving out over 100% APY in the early days before people caught on (it's still around 40% APY).</p>\n<p>In the meantime, the swap price for $GHOST went from about 1 million $GHOST per WICP to approximately 35,000 $GHOST per WICP. This sudden price increase got everyone’s attention. The momentum kept going as the IC Ghost team wasn’t done with their airdrops. Besides the initial 510,000 drop, I’ve found tens of thousands of tokens dropped to different wallets where I hold various NFT collections.</p>\n<p>The short version is: this is what collectors on the IC have been waiting for!</p>\n<p>Every team wants to partner up to drop $GHOST to holders as it is driving up NFT floor prices. Also, other teams that were considering a token launch are now racing to jump on the DeFi bandwagon. So let me run down some of the latest news I have heard on the token drop front (and how it has been impacting floor prices):</p>\n<h2 id=\"projects-being-impacted-by-token-rumors\">Projects Being Impacted By Token Rumors</h2>\n<p>Basically, if an NFT project's floor price is up in the past week, and you don’t know why, you probably just missed the token announcement. Here are some notable ones:</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><a data-no-swup=\"\" data-fslightbox=\"\" href=\"https://www.coinhustle.com/content/images/2023/07/image-61.png\" aria-label=\"Click for Lightbox\"><figure class=\"lazyload lazy loaded\"><img  src=\"https://www.coinhustle.com/content/images/2023/07/image-61.png\" srcset=\"https://www.coinhustle.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/07/image-61.png 600w, https://www.coinhustle.com/content/images/2023/07/image-61.png 700w\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"703\" loading=\"lazy\" data-was-processed=\"true\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></a>\n<figcaption>The Dfinity Donkeys team started their airdrops on August 1st. The second round is scheduled for September 1st, with three more rounds to go after that.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>· <strong>Dfinity Donkeys</strong> – As I stated in the beginning of the article, the Donks are just about ready for their second of five $DONGE token airdrops to holders. So even if you missed the first drop, you will still have several more chances. Donkey NFTs get 200k tokens per NFT with each drop. Snapshots will be taken at different intervals so be sure to check their Discord to learn how to get your tokens.</p>\n<p>The big news is that $DONGE will soon be tradable/stakeable on ICPSwap. The team has mentioned it could be in as little as one week. After the announcement in the project's Discord, the Dfinty Donkey floor price immediately jumped from 0.39 ICP to 0.59 ICP, a 51% increase within just a few hours. The team is currently discussing marketing approaches (e.g., drops for other project holders) in their Discord, and that is also where you can read the DONGE token whitepaper.</p>\n<p><strong>BREAKING NEWS: </strong>On Tuesday, DONGE became tradeable on ICPSwap, and the Donkeys floor rose again to 1.1 ICP in a matter of minutes. That brought the floor price increase over the past 48 hours to 182%.  </p>\n<p>· <strong>ICDrip</strong> – If you don’t believe in the power of the token drop, just take a look at the floor price of ICDrip in the past 24 hours. This was one of the earliest projects on the IC and was basically a derivative of the Loot NFTs on Ethereum. It was also a free airdrop, and while the floor prices got to around 3 ICP in the early days, just a couple of days ago, the floor price was 0.5 ICP. Now it is back up to 1.98 ICP.</p>\n<p>What caused the 296% leap in floor price? A community-driven token has been announced as a future airdrop to holders. That’s right; this is the first meme coin drop <a href=\"https://twitter.com/icdrip_icd?ref=coinhustle.com\">organized by the community</a> for a project that basically has not had any news in months. So while the developers behind ICDrip seem to be a little MIA, the IC Drip community is still strong, and the ICD token is the proof.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><a data-no-swup=\"\" data-fslightbox=\"\" href=\"https://www.coinhustle.com/content/images/2023/07/image-62.png\" aria-label=\"Click for Lightbox\"><figure class=\"lazyload lazy loaded\"><img  src=\"https://www.coinhustle.com/content/images/2023/07/image-62.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"497\" height=\"496\" loading=\"lazy\" data-was-processed=\"true\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></a>\n<figcaption>An IC Drip NFT</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>· <strong>Gigaverse Lab</strong>s – Numerous NFT projects from the Gigaverse team has seen the floor pump. The ICPunks floor price is up from 7.8 ICP to 13.9 ICP in under two weeks. The Infinity Frogs floor price is up from 3.5 ICP to 5.5 ICP. The ICats floor price is up from 0.8 ICP to 1 ICP. And the Infinity Flies floor price is holding steady at 0.5 ICP.</p>\n<p>Why? The Gigaverse team announced a token that will arrive after the <em>Wild and West</em> launch on the Solana chain, following the release of their ICP&lt;&gt;SOL bridge. The details are in their Discord, and the token will be dropped to all of the team’s IC NFT project holders as well as the team’s ETH/MATIC/SOL NFT project holders if they have been bridged to the IC. Different NFTs receive varying amounts of tokens, so be sure to learn more in the Gigaverse Discord.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-infinity-gems-nft-collection-token-drop\">The Infinity Gems NFT Collection Token Drop</h2>\n<p>DKLord and Egido Val, two of the biggest names in the ICP NFT community, have been preparing NFTs for their Infinity Gems collection, a collaboration with InfinitySwap. Their collaboration is more unique than simply being dropped NFTs to passive holders; this collection involves an airdrop of tokens that must then be <em>burned </em>in order to obtain the NFTs. With all of the fervor over token drops from collections with little to no marketing from the teams themselves, I’m very interested in seeing what happens when powerhouse artists and developers collab for a project that involves incredible artwork, well-known teams, powerful marketing, and the community’s hottest new AMM.</p>\n<p>Until next time, keep checking your wallets. It seems like you never know when $GHOST or some other token is going to end up in there!</p>",
